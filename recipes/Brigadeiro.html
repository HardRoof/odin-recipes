    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brigadeiro is one of the preeminent desserts in Brazil and incredibly simple to make. 
    Every party, from kids birthdays to weddings, is expected to have a large supply of brigadeiro.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can of condensed milk</li>
        <li>4-7 table Spoons of Chocolate Powder (The more you add, the more chocolate flavour it will have)</li>
        <li>1-2 tea spoons of butter</li>
        <li>Toppings(sprinkles, dehydrated coconut, powdered milk, or sugar)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the condensed milk, chocolate power, and butter in one pot on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Stir the ingredients constantly until the mixture stops sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Pour the ingredients out onto a large plate or tray (be careful, it will be hot)</li>
        <li>Wait for a little bit for it to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Put a bit of butter on your hands (to help you roll)</li>
        <li>Using a tea spoon, scoop a small amount of the mixture, and roll into a ball.</li>
        <li>Have a small bowl (or mug) filled with sprinkles, dehydrated coconut, powdered milk, 
            or sugar. Drop the rolled brigadeiro inside and shake the bowl to cover the brigadeiro 
            in the topping of your choice.</li>
        <li>Plate and serve (Depending on the size you roll them, it makes 30-50 brigadeiros).</li>
    </ol>
